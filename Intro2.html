	<h1>Starting up</h1>

	<p>The villagers took me in and raised me as one of them. Shmurda took me in as his own kid and raised me to be the next villager chief. Shmurda taught me the basics of being a minecraft villager. [fast forward 4 years] Babadaoski is now 16 years old. He became the strongest fighter in town. One day he decided to go to the village library. There he found some scrolls that caught his interest. One of the scrolls was a picture of him with a sword fighting against a black Dragon, the Ender Dragon. He realizes this is his destiny and is probably the only way for him to learn more about his past or to go back home.</p>
