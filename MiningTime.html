	<h1>Time to mine</h1>
	<p>Babadaoski goes to the mines to get some diamonds. He decides that the best way to reach diamond level is to dig straight down. While mining he realizes it was nighttime. As he is mining he remembers a quote: "Don't mine at night" - Mahatma Ghandi. He dismisses Ghandi's advice and continues digging down. Finally he finds a diamond. He mines that diamond and finds another one underneath. As he mines that one, he suddenly falls. Time flows slowly as he is falling. He realizes that he is going to fall in lava. During the fall he remembered his time with the villagers and with Shmurda. He shed his final tear and muttered his final words: <button onclick="document.getElementById('sound1').play();">click to play</button></p>
